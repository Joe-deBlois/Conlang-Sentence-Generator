This is a program to help conlangers by randomly generating words or sentences given some user input. 

app-initialization.py should be run first; it prompts the user to select between options 1 or 2. 

If option 1 is selected, option1.py will automatically run. This program's userface is through tkinter.
* The user will select IPA characters they want in their words, and the frequency of those sounds. 
* They will also develop legal syllable structures, and the phoneme frequencies will be used to set frequencies to each syllable. (to do)
* Then the user will specify the number of words desired and the maximum and minimum length of any word. (to do)
* Finally the program will output a plaintext file of randomly generated words following these guidelines. (to do)

If option 2 is selected, option2.py will automatically run. 
* All the user has to do for this program is input words or a sentence from their conlang, max word length, and the number of words they want. The program specifies some rules on how these words should be inputted. 
* The program begins by gathering data on the inputted string's phonemes (e.g. manner of articulation and counts) and syllables (in IPA form and C/V form). This is done in the Phonotactic Syllabifier section.
* Next the words are run though a Morphological Segmentor. This classifies each syllable as a prefix, suffix, root, floating morpheme, stand-alone morpheme (such as an article or determiner in English), or more flexible morphemes like prefix/root, prefix/suffix, or root/suffix. Given user input, it also assigns which combinations of these segments are valid based on the language's morphological typology. 
* Lastly, all of the collected information is run through the Word Generator. Using frequencies and weights, the program utilizes old morphemes and generates new ones to create novel words for your conlang!
